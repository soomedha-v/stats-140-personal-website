## Description  
This project investigates the impact of tennis court surfacesâ€”clay, hard, and grassâ€”on player performance, focusing on the specific skills that lead to success on each surface. Through analysis of ATP player statistics, the study explores correlations between attributes like rally length, serve percentages, and return performance across different surfaces. The aim is to identify which skills drive success on each court type and how they influence overall win percentages.

## Summary  
The study revealed that surface type significantly impacts the skills required for success. On **hard courts**, a playerâ€™s ability to serve effectively and win return points had moderate positive correlations with their win percentage, while rally length had minimal impact. On **clay courts**, the serve was less important, and return of serve was crucial. **Grass courts** showed no strong correlation between ace percentages or first serve win rates with win percentage, likely due to a small sample size and slower court surfaces. The project also emphasized how modern tennis is shifting towards more versatile, all-court players, with traditional "specialists" becoming less common.
