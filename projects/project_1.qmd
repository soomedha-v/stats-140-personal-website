## Description  
This project analyzes the relationship between NBA rookies' physical attributesâ€”such as height, wingspan, and weightâ€”and their defensive performance. Using data from the NBA rookie combine and season statistics, we investigate whether traits like wingspan-to-height ratio correlate with defensive metrics such as steals, blocks, and rebounds.  

## Summary  
While initial hypotheses suggested that physical traits would strongly influence defensive stats, our analysis found weak correlations between attributes and performance. A Random Forest Regressor model was used to predict defensive metrics, but results showed limited predictive power for steals and blocks. However, rebounds exhibited a stronger correlation with physical traits, suggesting that while certain attributes may provide an advantage, defensive ability is influenced by more than just measurable factors. This project highlights the importance of considering intangibles like positioning, game awareness, and strategy when evaluating a playerâ€™s defensive potential.
