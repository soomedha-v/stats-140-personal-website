    "text": "About Me\nAs a junior at UCLA studying Statistics and Data Science with a minor in Accounting, I‚Äôve had the chance to work on a variety of projects that have sharpened my data analysis skills and deepened my understanding of how data can drive real-world impact. I‚Äôve tackled complex research, including analyzing air quality metrics and exploring data in sports analytics, where I used tools like Python, SQL, and R to uncover insights that support meaningful outcomes.\nAlongside these experiences, I‚Äôve gained valuable skills in time management, communication, and problem-solving, which I bring to every role. I‚Äôm excited to continue building my career in data analysis, especially in settings where I can combine my technical skills with my commitment to service and collaboration. With mentorship from business leaders and experience working closely with teams, I‚Äôm eager to contribute and grow in a role that makes a positive difference."

    "text": "Summary\nWhile initial hypotheses suggested that physical traits would strongly influence defensive stats, our analysis found weak correlations between attributes and performance. A Random Forest Regressor model was used to predict defensive metrics, but results showed limited predictive power for steals and blocks. However, rebounds exhibited a stronger correlation with physical traits, suggesting that while certain attributes may provide an advantage, defensive ability is influenced by more than just measurable factors. This project highlights the importance of considering intangibles like positioning, game awareness, and strategy when evaluating a player‚Äôs defensive potential.\nüîó Read more: Unlocking the Defensive Code"

    "text": "This project investigates the impact of tennis court surfaces‚Äîclay, hard, and grass‚Äîon player performance, focusing on the specific skills that lead to success on each surface. Through analysis of ATP player statistics, the study explores correlations between attributes like rally length, serve percentages, and return performance across different surfaces. The aim is to identify which skills drive success on each court type and how they influence overall win percentages."

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\nThe study revealed that surface type significantly impacts the skills required for success. On hard courts, a player‚Äôs ability to serve effectively and win return points had moderate positive correlations with their win percentage, while rally length had minimal impact. On clay courts, the serve was less important, and return of serve was crucial. Grass courts showed no strong correlation between ace percentages or first serve win rates with win percentage, likely due to a small sample size and slower court surfaces. The project also emphasized how modern tennis is shifting towards more versatile, all-court players, with traditional ‚Äúspecialists‚Äù becoming less common.\nüîó Read more: Decoding Surface Dominance: The Skills Behind Tennis Triumphs"
