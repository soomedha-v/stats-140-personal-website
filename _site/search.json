    "text": "About Me\nAs a junior at UCLA studying Statistics and Data Science with a minor in Accounting, I’ve had the chance to work on a variety of projects that have sharpened my data analysis skills and deepened my understanding of how data can drive real-world impact. I’ve tackled complex research, including analyzing air quality metrics and exploring data in sports analytics, where I used tools like Python, SQL, and R to uncover insights that support meaningful outcomes.\nAlongside these experiences, I’ve gained valuable skills in time management, communication, and problem-solving, which I bring to every role. I’m excited to continue building my career in data analysis, especially in settings where I can combine my technical skills with my commitment to service and collaboration. With mentorship from business leaders and experience working closely with teams, I’m eager to contribute and grow in a role that makes a positive difference."
